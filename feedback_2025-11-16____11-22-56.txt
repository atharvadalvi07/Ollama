The provided code defines a function `sub` that takes two arguments and returns their difference. However, the intention seems to be to perform addition instead of subtraction.

In the `main` function, variables `x` and `y` are defined with values 5 and 1 respectively, and the `sub(x, y)` is called, which will actually subtract `y` from `x`. The intention appears to be adding `x` and `y` together instead. 

Additionally, the naming of functions and variables could be more descriptive for better clarity. For example, using `add_numbers` for both the function name and variable names can make the code easier to understand at a glance.

The current structure is fine; it’s straightforward and follows Python conventions. However, if there were errors or issues with the logic, they might have been related to the specific operation intended (subtraction instead of addition).
